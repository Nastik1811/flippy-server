# Flippy - Server Side
### About Flippy
Flippy is a simple and beautiful project created to help people memorise things better. The idea under the app is based on the spaced repetition technique - a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material to exploit the psychological spacing effect - which is usually performed with flashcards.
